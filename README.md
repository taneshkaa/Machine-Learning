**Predictions using Supervised Machine Learning -:**

Using Spervised Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Student's Grades (Local Dataset), if He/She studies for n number of Hours/Day [9:25, 9:50, 10:00, 10:10]. Applying Linear Regression for predicting Student's Percentage based on the number of Study Hours.


**Predictions using Unsupervised Machine Learning-: **

For the Iris Dataset Predictions are done using Unsupervised Machine Learning. KMeans Clusering is applied over IRIS Dataset, Analysis and Modelling of Dataset in order to get the Accuracies of different Models.
